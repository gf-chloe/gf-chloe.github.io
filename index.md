I am a first-year PhD student at the [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/), in the [Department of Linguistics](https://dornsife.usc.edu/ling/). I received my MA in Linguistics from [Université Paris-Diderot](http://www.linguist.univ-paris-diderot.fr/presentation_anglais) (France) in June 2018.
