I am a first-year PhD candidate at the [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/), in the [Department of Linguistics](https://dornsife.usc.edu/ling/). 

I graduated from Université Paris-Diderot (France) in June 2018. My areas of interests are phonetics and phonology, and everything that might be related to the sounds of languages. In my master's thesis, I focused on positional allophones of ejectives. I showed that the phonetic realization of Georgian ejective stops was different in two contexts, and among speakers, and are not consistent with variations of glottal tension.
