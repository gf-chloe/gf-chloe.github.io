<p style="font-size:160%;"> I am a first-year PhD candidate at the [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/), in the [Department of Linguistics](https://dornsife.usc.edu/ling/). <br>

I graduated from Université Paris-Diderot (France) in June 2018. <br> </p>

<p style="font-size:200%;"> My areas of interests are phonetics and phonology, and everything that might be related to the sounds of languages. In my master's thesis, I focused on positional allophones of ejectives. I showed that the phonetic realization of Georgian ejective stops was different in two contexts, and among speakers, and are not consistent with variations of glottal tension.
