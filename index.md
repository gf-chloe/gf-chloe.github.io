## [kloʊi kfeɫɚ]

I am a first-year PhD candidate at the [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/), in the [Department of Linguistics](https://dornsife.usc.edu/ling/). I graduated from Université Paris-Diderot in June 2018. My areas of interests are phonetics and phonology, and everything that might be related to the sounds of languages.

For my master's thesis, I focused on allophonic realizations of ejective stops in Georgian.
