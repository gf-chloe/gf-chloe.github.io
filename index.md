I am a first-year PhD candidate at the [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/), in the [Department of Linguistics](https://dornsife.usc.edu/ling/). I received my MA in Linguistics from Université Paris-Diderot (France) in June 2018.

I am particularly interested in phonetics and phonology, and in anything that is related to the sounds of languages. In my master's thesis, I studied positional allophones of ejectives. I showed that the phonetic realization of Georgian ejective stops was different in two contexts and among speakers, and are not consistent with variations of glottal tension.
